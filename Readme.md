# Traffic Accident Data Analysis System

## Description
The Traffic Accident Data Analysis System is a Python-based project that analyzes synthetic traffic accident data to identify high-risk times of day and accident-prone locations. The project uses data visualization techniques such as trend plots and heatmaps to clearly represent accident patterns, helping in better understanding, reporting, and decision-making

## Data Visualization
This project analyzes synthetic traffic accident data using **Python** to identify **high-risk times of day**, **high-risk locations**, and visualizes these patterns using **trend plots and heatmaps**. The dataset is generated automatically and is suitable for analysis, visualization, and reporting.

##  Technologies Used
This project is built using the following:

###  Programming Language
- **Python 3.x**

###  Python Libraries
- **pandas** – for loading, cleaning, and       manipulating data  
- **matplotlib** – for drawing line and bar charts  
- **seaborn** – for heatmap visualizations  
- **os** – for handling file paths and directories

###  File Formats
- **CSV** – for the dataset (`accidents.csv`)
- **Python (.py)** – for code scripts
